Proposal - Leverage the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to enable promptable image segmentation, facilitating a highly adaptable and precise approach for identifying diverse cellular structures. This model will support segmentation based on various input prompts, such as points, boxes, or masks, allowing researchers to efficiently analyze complex biological images with minimal pre-processing.

Integrate CoTracker, an advanced transformer-based architecture designed for dense point tracking across video sequences. This model will ensure accurate and consistent tracking of features over time, making it ideal for studying dynamic processes in biological or other temporal datasets. Together, these tools significantly enhance the ability to interpret and analyze spatial and temporal data in image and video analysis workflows.
